# mksgen14

RAMPS/MKS GEN 1.4 board is a versatile board based on Arduino Mega 2560.
It's designed to be used as a 3D Printer controller, but can be put to many
good uses as a generic robotic contoller.

This board is supported through the Marlin firmware which is focussed on making this
board for its intended usage: 3D printer controller. The mksgen14 library is an attempt
to make it useful as a general purpose controller.
